<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
<p>
The <strong>device_reply_server</strong> function is the MIG generated server handling
function to handle messages from kernel device drivers.  Such
messages were sent in response to the various
<strong>device_</strong>...<strong>_request</strong>...
calls.  It is assumed when using 
those calls that some task is listening for reply messages on the port named as a 
reply port to those calls.  The <strong>device_reply_server</strong>
function performs all
necessary argument handling for a kernel message and calls one
of the device server functions to interpret the message.
<h3>RETURN VALUES</h3>
<dl>
<p>
<dt> <strong>TRUE</strong>
<dd>
The message was handled and the appropriate function was called.
<p>
<dt> <strong>FALSE</strong>
<dd>
The message did not apply to this device handler interface and no other 
action was taken.
