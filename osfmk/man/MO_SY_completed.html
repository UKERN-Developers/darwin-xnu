<hr>
<p>
<strong>Function</strong> - Inform the kernel that synchronized data has been processed.
<h3>SYNOPSIS</h3>
<pre>
<strong>kern_return_t   memory_object_synchronize_completed </strong>
                <strong>(memory_object_control_t</strong>         <var>memory_control</var>,
                 <strong>vm_offset_t</strong>                             <var>offset</var>,
                 <strong>vm_offset_t</strong>                             <var>length</var><strong>);</strong>
</pre>
<h3>PARAMETERS</h3>
<dl>
<p>
<dt> <var>memory_control</var> 
<dd>
[in memory-cache-control send right]
The memory cache control port 
to be used by the memory manager for cache management requests. 
This port is provided by the kernel in a <strong>memory_object_init</strong> call.
<p>
<dt> <var>offset</var> 
<dd>
[in scalar]
The offset within the memory object, in bytes.
<p>
<dt> <var>length</var> 
<dd>
[in scalar]
The amount of data processed.  The number must be an
integral number of memory object pages.
</dl>
<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
<p>
The <strong>memory_object_synchronize_completed</strong> function informs the kernel 
that previously synchronized data (<strong>memory_object_synchronize</strong>) 
has been queued or placed on backing storage.  This reply causes the issuing
client to return from its <strong>vm_msync</strong> call.  The offset and length
must match that of the corresponding <strong>memory_object_synchronize</strong> 
call.  There may be multiple synchronize requests 
for a given memory object outstanding but they will not overlap.
<h3>RETURN VALUES</h3>
<p>
Only generic errors apply.
